 *
 * This is an implementation of the LinearHashChain algorithm, (currently unpublished) by Matt Palmer.
 * It is a factor search similar to WFR or the QF family of algorithms, but with linear performance in the worst case.
 *
 * It builds a hash table containing entries for chains of hashes.  Hashes are chained together by
 * placing a fingerprint of the *next* hash into the entry for the *current* hash.  This enables
 * a check for the second hash value to be performed without requiring a second lookup in the hash table.
 *
 * It creates Q chains of hashes from the end of the pattern back to the start.  Two techniques are used to ensure
 * linear performance. (1) During the filtering phase scanning back, it will not scan back over bytes it has already
 * matched previously. (2) During the verification phase, a linear matching algorithm (KMP) is used to identify any
 * possible matches, which will not re-verify bytes which have already been matched.
 *
 * Performance is very similar to HashChain on average, but remains linear when given worst-case and low entropy data
 * (for example, a lengthy text and patterns with an alphabet of 1, e.g. the entire text is made up of the same character.)
 *
 * This implementation is written to integrate with the SMART string search benchmarking tool,
 * by Simone Faro, Matt Palmer, Stefano Stefano Scafiti and Thierry Lecroq.
