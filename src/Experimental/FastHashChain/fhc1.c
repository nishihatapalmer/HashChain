 *
 * This is an implementation of the HashChain algorithm, (currently unpublished) by Matt Palmer.
 * It is a factor search similar to WFR or the QF family of algorithms.
 *
 * It builds a hash table containing entries for chains of hashes.  Hashes are chained together by
 * placing a fingerprint of the *next* hash into the entry for the *current* hash.  This enables
 * a check for the second hash value to be performed without requiring a second lookup in the hash table.
 *
 * It creates Q chains of hashes from the end of the pattern back to the start.
 *
 * This implementation is written to integrate with the SMART string search benchmarking tool,
 * by Simone Faro, Matt Palmer, Stefano Stefano Scafiti and Thierry Lecroq.
